Explanation of the Code:
Loading the Dataset: The Titanic dataset is read into a Pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv().

Mean Fare Calculation:

The groupby() function is used to group the data by Sex and Pclass.
The mean() function calculates the average fare for each combination of sex and class.
The results are reset into a new DataFrame for easier reading.
Median Age of Deceased Passengers:

The dataset is filtered to include only the passengers who did not survive (df['Survived'] == 0).
The groupby() function is again used to group this filtered data by Sex, and the median() function computes the median age.
The mean age is similarly computed using the mean() function.
Output:
The output will display the mean fare for each combination of sex and passenger class.
The median and mean ages of passengers who died, grouped by their sex.
